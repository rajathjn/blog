The Josephus problem is a theoretical problem that goes like this:

There are n people standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n. 
Starting from person 1, a hot potato is passed around the circle in a clockwise direction. 
After a certain number of passes, the person holding the hot potato is eliminated and removed from the circle. 
The process continues until only one person remains. 
The task is to determine the position of the last person remaining.
